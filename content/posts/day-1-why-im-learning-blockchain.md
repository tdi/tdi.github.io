## Why Blockchain? Why Now?

After 20+ years as a CTO in traditional tech companies, including my current role at Worksuite and previous experience as VP Engineering at Nordcloud, I've decided to make a significant career pivot into the blockchain and Web3 space.

## The Market Opportunity

The numbers are compelling:
- Global crypto market hit $3 trillion in November 2024
- Web3 developer salaries are 30% higher than traditional tech
- Massive shortage of experienced technical leadership in crypto

## My Background

Coming from:
- **20+ years** in technology leadership
- **Academic background** at Poznań University of Technology
- **Cloud and DevOps expertise** from Nordcloud
- **Enterprise software development** experience

## What I'm Learning

My learning roadmap includes:
1. **Blockchain fundamentals** - consensus mechanisms, cryptography
2. **Smart contract development** - Solidity, Ethereum ecosystem
3. **Web3 development** - dApps, wallet integration
4. **DeFi protocols** - Understanding decentralized finance
5. **Enterprise adoption** - How traditional companies can leverage blockchain

## Goals for This Journey

- Document everything I learn publicly
- Build a portfolio of blockchain projects
- Connect with the crypto community
- Eventually land a CTO role in Web3
- Help bridge the gap between traditional tech and blockchain

## Why Share Publicly?

Learning in public has several benefits:
- Accountability to keep learning consistently
- Building credibility in the space
- Networking with like-minded professionals
- Helping other CTOs who might be considering similar transitions

## What's Next?

Tomorrow I'll dive into blockchain fundamentals and start the Free Code Camp 32-hour blockchain course. I'll document key insights and challenges as I go.
